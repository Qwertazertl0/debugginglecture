# url shortener

A simple flask app that takes a URL:

```
https://github.com/Joshuad2uiuc
```

And prints a "shortened" aliased URL relative to localhost to your console:

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/0
```

## Installation

```
pip install flask
```

or if you are using python3

```
pip3 install flask
```

You may have to run the code with sudo in front of it.

## Run the server

```
python server.py
```
